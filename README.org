=Dape= is a debug adapter client for Emacs. The debug adapter protocol, much like its more well-known counterpart, the language server protocol, aims to establish a common API for programming tools. However, instead of functionalities such as code completions, it provides a standardized interface for debuggers.

To begin a debugging session, invoke the ~dape~ command. In the minibuffer prompt, enter a debug adapter configuration name from ~dape-configs~.

For complete functionality, make sure to enable ~eldoc-mode~ in your source buffers and ~repeat-mode~ for more pleasant key mappings.

* Features
+ Batteries included support (~describe-variable~ ~dape-configs~)
+ Log breakpoints
+ Conditional breakpoints
+ Variable explorer
+ Variable watch
+ Variable hover with ~eldoc~
+ REPL
+ gdb-mi.el like interface
+ Memory editor with ~hexl~
+ Integration with ~compile~
+ Debug adapter configuration ergonomics
+ No external dependencies outside of core Emacs

With ~(setq dape-buffer-window-arrangement 'right)~:

And with ~(setq dape-buffer-window-arrangement 'gud)~ + =corfu= as ~completion-in-region-function~:

And with minibuffer config hints:

* Configuration
=Dape= includes pre-defined debug adapter configurations for various programming languages. Refer to ~dape-configs~ for more details. If =dape= doesn't include a configuration suitable for your needs, you can implement your own.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dape
    :preface
    ;; By default dape shares the same keybinding prefix as `gud'
    ;; If you do not want to use any prefix, set it to nil.
    ;; (setq dape-key-prefix "\C-x\C-a")

    :hook
    ;; Save breakpoints on quit
    ;; ((kill-emacs . dape-breakpoint-save)
    ;; Load breakpoints on startup
    ;;  (after-init . dape-breakpoint-load))

    :init
    ;; To use window configuration like gud (gdb-mi)
    ;; (setq dape-buffer-window-arrangement 'gud)

    :config
    ;; Info buffers to the right
    ;; (setq dape-buffer-window-arrangement 'right)

    ;; Global bindings for setting breakpoints with mouse
    ;; (dape-breakpoint-global-mode)

    ;; To not display info and/or buffers on startup
    ;; (remove-hook 'dape-on-start-hooks 'dape-info)
    ;; (remove-hook 'dape-on-start-hooks 'dape-repl)

    ;; To display info and/or repl buffers on stopped
    ;; (add-hook 'dape-on-stopped-hooks 'dape-info)
    ;; (add-hook 'dape-on-stopped-hooks 'dape-repl)

    ;; Kill compile buffer on build success
    ;; (add-hook 'dape-compile-compile-hooks 'kill-buffer)

    ;; Save buffers on startup, useful for interpreted languages
    ;; (add-hook 'dape-on-start-hooks (lambda () (save-some-buffers t t)))

    ;; Projectile users
    ;; (setq dape-cwd-fn 'projectile-project-root)
    )

* Differences with dap-mode
Dape has no dependencies outside of core Emacs packages, and tries to use get as much out of them possible.

Dape takes a slightly different approach to configuration.
+ =Dape= does not support ~launch.json~ files, if per project configuration is needed use ~dir-locals~ and ~dape-command~.
+ =Dape= enhances ergonomics within the minibuffer by allowing users to modify or add PLIST entries to an existing configuration using options. For example ~dape-config :cwd default-directory :program ＂/home/user/b.out＂ compile ＂gcc -g -o b.out main.c＂~.
+ No magic, no special variables like =${workspaceFolder}=. Instead, functions and variables are resolved before starting a new session.
+ Tries to envision how debug adapter configurations would be implemented in Emacs if vscode never existed.

* Supported debug adapters
In theory all debug adapters should be compatible with =Dape=.

See https://github.com/microsoft/java-debug for installation of the Java Debug Server plugin.
The Java config depends on Eglot running JDTLS with the plugin prior to starting Dape.
Extend ~eglot-server-programs~ as follows to have JDTLS load the plugin:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
               `((java-mode java-ts-mode) .
                 ("jdtls"
                  :initializationOptions
                  (:bundles ["/PATH/TO/java-debug/com.microsoft.java.debug.plugin/target/com.microsoft.java.debug.plugin-VERSION.jar"]))))
#+end_src

** Other untested adapters
If you find a working configuration for any other debug adapter please submit a PR.

See [[https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/adapters/][microsofts list]] for other adapters, your mileage will vary.

* Bugs and issues
Before reporting any issues ~(setq dape-debug t)~ and take a look at =*dape-repl*= buffer. Please share your =*dape-repl*= and =*dape-connection events*= in the buffer contents with the bug report.
The =master= branch is used as an development branch and releases on elpa should be more stable so in the mean time use elpa if the bug is a breaking you workflow.
