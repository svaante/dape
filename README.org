#+title: Dape - Debug Adapter Protocol for Emacs
#+author: Daniel Pettersson
#+language: en

This package integrates debug adapters within Emacs.

Use ~dape-configs~ to set up your debug adapter configurations.
To initiate debugging sessions, use the command ~dape~.

For complete functionality, activate ~eldoc-mode~ in your source buffers and enable ~repeat-mode~ for ergonomics.

* Features
+ Log breakpoints
+ Conditional breakpoints
+ Variable explorer
+ Variable watch
+ Variable hover with ~eldoc~
+ REPL
+ Memory viewer with ~hexl~
+ ~compile~ integration
+ Debug adapter configuration ergonomics
+ No dependencies

* Configuration
Currently =Dape= does not come with any debug adapter configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dape
    ;; Currently only on github
    :straight (dape :type git :host github :repo "svaante/dape")
    :config
    ;; Use n for next etc. in REPL
    ;; (setq dape-repl-use-shorthand t)

    ;; By default dape uses gdb keybinding prefix
    ;; (setq dape-key-prefix "\C-x\C-a")

    ;; Kill compile buffer on build success
    ;; (add-hook 'dape-compile-compile-hooks 'kill-buffer)

    ;; Projectile users
    ;; (setq dape-cwd-fn 'projectile-project-root)
    )
#+end_src

* Differences with dap-mode
[[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode][dap-mode]] is the most popular alternative and is of course much more mature and probably more feature rich (have not used ~dap-mode~ extensively).

Dape has no dependencies outside of packages included in emacs, and tries to use get as much out of them possible.

Dape takes a slightly different approach to configuration.
+ Dape does not support ~launch.json~ files, if per project configuration is needed use ~dir-locals~.
+ Tries to simplify configuration, by having just a plist.
+ Dape tries to improve config ergonomics in ~dape~ completing-read by allowing to change/add plist entries in an already existing config, example: ~adapter-config :program ＂/home/user/b.out＂ :compile ＂gcc -g -o b.out main.c ＂~.
+ No magic, no special variables. Instead, functions and variables are resolved before starting a new session.
+ No batteries included. Many, suffer from a significant drawback: they're tightly coupled with the vscode extension they're bundled with. This tight coupling results in launch/attach requests being specific to each adapter, devoid of reasonable defaults as they are stored within the extension itself, leading to an ever-changing and unstable API. Consequently, attempting to include default configurations for each adapter seems like a losing proposition.
+ Tries to be envision to how debug adapter configuration would be implemented in emacs if vscode never existed.

Some might say that Dape has a nicer UI others might not.

* Supported debug adapters
In theory all debug adapters should be compatible with =Dape=.

** Other untested adapters
If you find a working configuration for any other debug adapter please submit a PR.

See [[https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/implementors/adapters/][microsofts list]] for other adapters, your mileage will vary.

* Roadmap
+ More options for indicator placement
+ Improving completion in REPL
+ Usage of "setVariable" inside of ~*dape-info*~ buffer
+ Exception breakpoints in ~*dape-info*~ buffer
+ Fleshed out memory reader with auto reload and write functionality
+ Individual thread controls
+ Variable values displayed in source buffer, this seams to require integration with lsp-mode and eglot

* Bugs and issues
Before reporting any issues take a look at ~*dape-debug*~ buffer with all debug messages enabled ~(setq dape--debug-on '(io info error std-server)~.
